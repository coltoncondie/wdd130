            <h2>Castle Valley</h2>
            <p>The most amazing thing about the Utah Rivers is they all have their own Temperments. Starting out, Castle Valley Utah has a very calm Gem of a river. The Colorado River gives our beginning rafters an injoyable experience with plenty of sites to take in. For ages 4 and up, a 1 to 3 day experience it is a great chance to get your feet wet! </p>

            <p>The Green River Desolation Canyon Trip is one<br> of the Big favorites for the White Water Rafting community.<br> It is a multi day trip which you traverse 96 mile<br> with over 60 rapid sections. One of the big reasons this<br> trip is so loved is we go through the largest<br> wilderness research area and pristine archelogical<br> sites left behind by the Fremont people 2000 years ago!</p>
