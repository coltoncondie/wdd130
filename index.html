        <p>Hey There! My name is Colton Michael Condie. I am from West Jordan, Utah, USA. I enjoy working with my hands building things with wood, like shaping intricate shapes, creating garden boxes and cabinets. Metallurgy is another type of building I enjoy frome welding to forging steel into different things, Art, Weapons tools, and parts for projects.
            Sports, my favorite sports are Baseball, Basketball, Tennis, Frisbee Golf, Soccer, Horse shoes, Football, and the list continues to grow! Spending time with my Family, when I have the time in my hard working life. I enjoy taking my family out for family fun activities, camping, movies, fishing, bowling. My family are also big into video games, and movies at home.
            Besides the things I enjoy, I am a hard working Father who is an Eagle Scout, and kind soul. My dream I aspire to achieve is to become an advanced Robotics Engineer, and AI Specialist.
